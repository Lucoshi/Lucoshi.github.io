<B>Wario Land 4 is an exciting new game in which Mario’s rival, Wario, searches a mysterious pyramid for treasure. The game combines traditional action elements such as running, jumping and swimming with many puzzle elements, as the player must figure out how to find hidden treasures. There are also three minigames.
<p>
Lending a comic touch to the game are Wario’s transformations into a bat, super-heavy Wario and more. These transformations are necessary to accomplish certain tasks.</p>

<p>Wario Land 4 is for one player. It can only be played on the Game Boy Advance. There are two save slots. The independent Entertainment Software Rating Board has rated Wario Land 4 "E" for "Everyone” with the descriptor of  “Comic Mischief.” Games rated "E" are suitable for persons age six or older.</p>

Box-office cash registers will be ka-chinging coast-to-coast as word hits the street about the biggest and best thriller yet from dapper action hero Wario.
<BR><BR>
Pitt's the pits and Cruise is yesterday's news but with Wario, ya got the real tough-guy deal. In WL4 the yellow-capped dynamo searches for his own private El Dorado in a pyramid hidden deep within a jungle. Armed with little more than courage and staggeringly good looks, Wario ventures into four mysterious jewel-monikered passages. Talk about screen gems!
<BR><BR>
Studio execs obviously spared no expense when it came to location shooting, taking the crew to a typhoon-lashed jungle, a haunted village and even a toxic-waste dump. Phew! The equally impressive CGI special effects include flying carpets and floating ghosts. In an industry first, producers ordered a crayon-colored set for show-stopping sequence in which Wario journeys through a child's sketch book. Color me handsome, baby!
<BR><BR>
Wario is of course the premiere cinematic artiste of his generation and in WL4 his dedication to his craft knows no bounds. When whacked by a hammer, Wario turns into a giant spring to bash through ceilings. When stung by a hovering hornet, Wario puffs up like a zeppelin and floats ceiling-ward. We're dying to find out the special FX secret behind this husky hero morphing into a tiny bat.
<BR><BR>
Crammed with thrills, chills and, lest we forget, a heart-pounding soundtrack, WL4 figures to be a lock for Best Pic at next year's Academy Awards. Meow! Tinsel Town is oh so jealous!

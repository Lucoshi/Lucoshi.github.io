<b>What's new in the Game Boy Advance version of Donkey Kong Country?</b>
</p>

        <p> Plenty. Donkey Kong Country is now better than ever thanks to some 
          great special features exclusive to the GBA version of the game. Funky's 
          Fishing is a new mini-game which challenges you to hook as many fish 
          as you can within a time limit, and Candy's Dance Studio will test your 
          rhythm with fun dance games. Either the main adventure or these new 
          mini-games can be played with one or two players!</p>        <p> Other additions include collectable character art (earned by finding 
          hidden cameras throughout the game) and a detailed statistics tracker. 
          A new DK Attack mode ranks your performance on completed levels based 
          on a number of factors. To get the best score, you'll have to exhibit 
          near-perfect skill on each level.</p>

<p>
<b>Where is a good spot to get lots of free lives?</b>
</p>

        <p> Jungle Hijinx is a great spot to build up extra lives. First, finish 
          the level. Then re-enter the level and work your way back to the Continue 
          Barrel. Next, go to the right and collect the golden Expresso Animal 
          Token. Press Start and exit the level. Re-enter the level and get the 
          Animal Token again. Repeat this until you get three animal tokens and 
          you'll go to the Expresso bonus level. In the bonus level you'll be 
          able to pick up at least 5 or 6 extra lives every time!</p>

<p>
<b>How do I get items that are floating in mid-air?</b>
</p>

        <p> Do the Barrel Roll off a ledge, then jump while you're still rolling 
          to gain some extra distance.</p>

<p>
<b>How do I go back to worlds that I've already finished?</b>
</p>

        <p> Talk to Funky Kong to take one of Funky's Flights to a previous area.</p>

<p>
<b>Is there a code or trick to get the original Donkey Kong game?</b>
</p>

<p>
No.
